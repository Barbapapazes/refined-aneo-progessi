# Userscript: Refined GitHub Notifications

Enhances the GitHub Notifications page, making it more productive and less noisy.

[Install on Greasyfork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/461320-refined-github-notifications)

## Introduction

Check [Anthony's Talk](https://youtu.be/gu-0b6KCf80) or the [Transcripts](https://antfu.me/posts/manage-github-notifcations-2023) to learn more about the philosophy and motivations behind this userscript.

## Features

> **Note**: It's pretty opinionated. I'd encourage you to fork and customize it to your own needs.

- Remove cards on the dashboard "Arrêts", "Nos talents", "Affaires gagnées", "Expensya", "Fiches Favorites", "Documents", "Taux de production" and "Documents institutionnels"
- Remove "solde CP" and "RTT" since they are not used
- Add a lint to Expensya on the header
- In "Ma feuille de temps", I remove duplicate UI elements and everything related to "hour" since it's not used
